If you've ever tried to run Kubernetes on a Raspberry Pi or a small edge device, you know the pain. Traditional Kubernetes distributions are resource-hungry beasts that require gigabytes of RAM and multiple CPU cores just to get started. What if I told you there's a way to run a fully certified Kubernetes cluster with just 512MB of RAM? Enter K3s—the game-changer for edge computing and IoT deployments.

**K3s is a certified, lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed specifically for resource-constrained environments**. It's packaged as a single binary under 70MB and can run on everything from a Raspberry Pi to a full-scale server. Think of it as Kubernetes without the bloat, perfect for edge computing, IoT devices, and development environments where every megabyte matters.

## What is K3s?

K3s (pronounced "k3s") is a **highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution** that strips away the complexity and resource requirements of traditional Kubernetes while maintaining full API compatibility. Originally developed by Rancher Labs and now a CNCF Sandbox Project, K3s is built for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, and remote locations.

The name "K3s" comes from the fact that it's a 5-letter word (Kubernetes) minus 2 letters, representing the simplified nature of the distribution. But don't let the name fool you—this isn't a toy version of Kubernetes. It's a fully functional, production-ready platform that passes all Kubernetes conformance tests.

### Key Components

```

### Multi-Node Cluster

Setting up a multi-node cluster is equally straightforward:

**On the master node:**
```bash
# Install K3s server
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

# Get the node token for joining agents
sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
```

**On worker nodes:**
```bash
# Install K3s agent
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://myserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN sh -
```

### Using K3s with kubectl

Once installed, you can use K3s with standard kubectl commands:

```bash
# Use K3s kubectl directly
sudo k3s kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

# Or copy kubeconfig to use with regular kubectl
sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
kubectl get nodes
```

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. **Development and Testing**

K3s is perfect for local development environments where you want to test Kubernetes applications without the overhead of a full cluster:

```bash
# Quick local cluster for testing
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80
```

### 2. **Edge Computing**

```

## Common Gotchas and Solutions

### 1. **Port Conflicts**

K3s uses different default ports than standard Kubernetes:

- **API Server**: 6443 (same as standard)
- **NodePort**: 30000-32767 (same as standard)
- **Traefik**: 80, 443 (instead of nginx-ingress)

### 2. **Resource Limits**

Be mindful of resource constraints on edge devices:

```yaml
# Set resource limits for your pods
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "100m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "200m"
```

### 3. **Networking Issues**

If you encounter networking problems:

```bash
# Check Flannel status
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep flannel

# Restart Flannel if needed
kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l app=flannel
```

## Conclusion
