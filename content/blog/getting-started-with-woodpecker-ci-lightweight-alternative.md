Picture this: you're tasked with setting up a CI/CD pipeline for your team's project. You look at Jenkins and feel overwhelmed by its complexity. You consider GitHub Actions, but you want something self-hosted. GitLab CI is great, but it's too heavyweight for your needs. What if there was a simpler, lighter alternative that just works?

Enter **Woodpecker CI** – a lightweight, container-based CI/CD tool that brings simplicity back to continuous integration and deployment.

## What is Woodpecker CI?

Woodpecker CI is a CI/CD automation tool designed with three core principles in mind:

- **Lightweight**: It's so efficient it can run on a Raspberry Pi
- **Simple**: Clean, straightforward configuration with minimal complexity
- **Fast**: Container-based execution that gets your code from development to production quickly

If you've worked with Drone CI before, Woodpecker might look familiar – it's actually a community-maintained fork of Drone that emerged when Drone moved away from its open-source roots. The community took the reins and created something even better.

## Why Consider Woodpecker CI?

### The Traditional CI/CD Problem

Let's be honest: setting up CI/CD shouldn't require a PhD. Jenkins requires managing plugins, understanding Groovy, and dealing with a UI from 2010. GitLab CI is powerful but comes with the overhead of the entire GitLab platform. Even cloud-based solutions like CircleCI or Travis CI lock you into their ecosystem and pricing.

### The Woodpecker Approach

Woodpecker takes a different path:

1. **Container-Native**: Everything runs in containers. If you're already using Docker, you'll feel right at home.
2. **YAML Configuration**: Simple, declarative pipeline definitions in `.woodpecker.yml` files
3. **Self-Hosted**: Full control over your infrastructure and data
4. **Platform Integration**: Native support for GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, and Forgejo
5. **Minimal Resource Usage**: Doesn't eat your server resources for breakfast

## Getting Started with Woodpecker CI

### Prerequisites

Before diving in, you'll need:

- A server or VM (even a Raspberry Pi works!)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Access to a Git hosting platform (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, or Forgejo)
- Basic understanding of containers and YAML

### Quick Setup

Let's get Woodpecker up and running. The easiest way is using Docker Compose:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  woodpecker-server:
    image: woodpeckerci/woodpecker-server:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - woodpecker-server-data:/var/lib/woodpecker/
    environment:
      - WOODPECKER_OPEN=true
      - WOODPECKER_HOST=http://localhost:8000
      - WOODPECKER_GITHUB=true
      - WOODPECKER_GITHUB_CLIENT=${WOODPECKER_GITHUB_CLIENT}
      - WOODPECKER_GITHUB_SECRET=${WOODPECKER_GITHUB_SECRET}
      - WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET=${WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET}

  woodpecker-agent:
    image: woodpeckerci/woodpecker-agent:latest
    depends_on:
      - woodpecker-server
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - WOODPECKER_SERVER=woodpecker-server:9000
      - WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET=${WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET}

volumes:
  woodpecker-server-data:
```

Then spin it up:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Configuring Your Git Platform

You'll need to create an OAuth application on your Git platform. For GitHub:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **OAuth Apps**
2. Create a new OAuth App
3. Set the Homepage URL to your Woodpecker instance (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
4. Set the Authorization callback URL to `http://localhost:8000/authorize`
5. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

Add these to your environment variables:

```bash
$ export WOODPECKER_GITHUB_CLIENT=your_client_id
$ export WOODPECKER_GITHUB_SECRET=your_client_secret
$ export WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

## Creating Your First Pipeline

Now for the fun part – creating a pipeline! Let's build a simple Node.js application pipeline.

### Basic Pipeline Structure

Create a `.woodpecker.yml` file in your repository root:

```yaml
# .woodpecker.yml
when:
  - event: push
    branch: main

steps:
  install:
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - npm ci

  test:
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - npm test

  build:
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - npm run build

  deploy:
    image: plugins/docker
    settings:
      registry: docker.io
      repo: yourname/yourapp
      username:
        from_secret: docker_username
      password:
        from_secret: docker_password
      tags: latest
```

### Understanding the Pipeline

Let's break down what's happening:

1. **when**: Defines when the pipeline runs (on push to main branch)
2. **steps**: Individual stages of your pipeline, each running in its own container
3. **image**: The Docker image to use for each step
4. **commands**: Shell commands to execute

### The Conveyor Belt Analogy

Think of your pipeline as a conveyor belt in a factory:

- **Install step**: Gathering raw materials (dependencies)
- **Test step**: Quality control check
- **Build step**: Manufacturing the product
- **Deploy step**: Shipping to customers

Each step runs independently in a fresh container, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

## Advanced Features

### Matrix Builds

Need to test across multiple Node.js versions? Easy:

```yaml
matrix:
  NODE_VERSION:
    - 18
    - 20
    - 22

steps:
  test:
    image: node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine
    commands:
      - npm ci
      - npm test
```

This creates three parallel pipelines, one for each Node.js version.

### Using Secrets

Never hardcode credentials! Woodpecker has built-in secret management:

1. Add secrets through the Woodpecker UI for your repository
2. Reference them in your pipeline:

```yaml
steps:
  deploy:
    image: plugins/ssh
    settings:
      host: example.com
      username:
        from_secret: ssh_username
      password:
        from_secret: ssh_password
      script:
        - ./deploy.sh
```

### Service Containers

Need a database for testing? Use services:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: testdb
      POSTGRES_USER: test
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test

steps:
  test:
    image: node:20-alpine
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://test:test@postgres:5432/testdb
    commands:
      - npm test
```

The service container runs alongside your pipeline steps, accessible by its service name (`postgres` in this case).

## Real-World Use Cases

### Continuous Deployment for a Web App

Here's a complete pipeline for a Next.js app:

```yaml
when:
  - event: push
    branch: [main, develop]

steps:
  install:
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - npm ci

  lint:
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - npm run lint

  test:
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - npm test

  build:
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - npm run build
    when:
      branch: main

  deploy-staging:
    image: appleboy/ssh-action
    settings:
      host: staging.example.com
      username:
        from_secret: ssh_user
      key:
        from_secret: ssh_key
      script:
        - cd /var/www/app
        - git pull
        - npm ci
        - pm2 restart app
    when:
      branch: develop

  deploy-production:
    image: appleboy/ssh-action
    settings:
      host: example.com
      username:
        from_secret: ssh_user
      key:
        from_secret: ssh_key
      script:
        - cd /var/www/app
        - git pull
        - npm ci
        - npm run build
        - pm2 restart app
    when:
      branch: main
```

### Docker Image Build and Push

Building and publishing Docker images:

```yaml
steps:
  build-and-push:
    image: woodpeckerci/plugin-docker-buildx
    settings:
      registry: ghcr.io
      repo: ghcr.io/yourorg/yourapp
      username:
        from_secret: github_username
      password:
        from_secret: github_token
      tags:
        - latest
        - ${CI_COMMIT_SHA:0:8}
      platforms:
        - linux/amd64
        - linux/arm64
```

### When to Choose Woodpecker

Woodpecker is an excellent choice when:

- You want **full control** over your CI/CD infrastructure
- You need a **lightweight solution** that doesn't consume excessive resources
- You're already using **containers** in your workflow
- You prefer **simple, declarative configuration** over complex scripting
- You want to **avoid vendor lock-in** with cloud providers
- You're working with **smaller teams** or personal projects

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Connecting

**Problem**: Woodpecker agent can't connect to the server.

**Solution**: Ensure the `WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET` matches between server and agent:

```bash
$ docker logs woodpecker-agent
```

Look for authentication errors and verify your secret configuration.

### Pipeline Failing Silently

**Problem**: Pipeline steps complete but show no output.

**Solution**: Check your step configuration and ensure commands are properly formatted:

```yaml
steps:
  test:
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - set -e  # Exit on error
      - npm test
```

### Docker Socket Permission Issues

**Problem**: Agent can't access Docker socket.

**Solution**: Ensure proper permissions on `/var/run/docker.sock` or run the agent with appropriate privileges:

```yaml
woodpecker-agent:
  image: woodpeckerci/woodpecker-agent:latest
  privileged: true  # Use with caution
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Pipelines Fast

Minimize build times by:

- Using **slim Docker images** (Alpine-based when possible)
- **Caching dependencies** between runs
- Running **independent steps in parallel**

```yaml
steps:
  lint:
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - npm ci
      - npm run lint

  test:
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - npm ci
      - npm test

depends_on: []  # Run in parallel
```

### 2. Use Pipeline Templates

For multiple similar projects, create reusable pipeline templates:

```yaml
# .woodpecker/common.yml
variables:
  - &node-install
    image: node:20-alpine
    commands:
      - npm ci

# Then reference in your main pipeline
steps:
  install:
    <<: *node-install
```

### 3. Implement Proper Secret Management

- Store secrets in Woodpecker's secret management, not in your repository
- Use different secrets for different environments
- Rotate secrets regularly

### 4. Monitor Your Pipelines

Set up status badges in your README:

```markdown
[![Build Status](https://woodpecker.example.com/api/badges/yourorg/yourrepo/status.svg)](https://woodpecker.example.com/yourorg/yourrepo)
```

## My Experience with Woodpecker CI
